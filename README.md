#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
They are responsible for designing and implementing software solutions, collaborating with stakeholders to define requirements, and ensuring that the final product meets quality standards.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity,process and,  machine.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of a Software Development Life Cycle typically include: Planning, Requirement Gathering, Design, Implementation (Coding), Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. 
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework. 
Implementation (coding) - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches.
Deployment- launching saoftware or app
Maintenance- maintaining software is free from bugs and glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline while the Agile project management is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. In the waterfall methodology - there is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete, customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed and testing is done at the end of the development process. In the Agile methodology there is high flexibility, adapts easily to changing requirements, regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint and testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer. Their responsibilities are Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks. Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software. Report to the project manager about the progress of the software development.  

The QA or quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed. QA engineers monitor every phase of the software development process, including development, testing, debugging and delivery. They ensure that quality is maintained at every stage of the development process and that the final product meets the requirements. Their responsibilities are to collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements. Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. Confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment. Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. Develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools. 

In software development, the roles of the project manager may include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products. They help in discussing the project and its requirements with clients and software developers. Assemble and lead the software development team. Create the blueprint for the project, including the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines and laying out communication strategies. Supervising each stage of the software development project. Set the budget and ensure the project adheres to it as closely as possible. Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestones, deliverables and change requests. Deliver the completed software to the client and regularly check its performance.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
In software quality assurance, the different types of testing, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance, each focus on different levels of the software system, with unit testing examining individual components, integration testing checking interactions between components, system testing evaluating the entire system, and acceptance testing verifying if the software meets user requirements before deployment, all contributing to ensuring overall software quality by identifying and fixing bugs at various stages of development. 
Unit Testing:Testing individual units of code (functions, classes, modules) to verify they function as expected with proper inputs and outputs.Helps catch early errors in the code, improves code quality, and simplifies debugging by isolating issues to specific components. 
Integration Testing: Testing how different units of code interact with each other when combined to ensure seamless data flow and communication between modules. Identifies issues related to interfaces and data exchange between components, helping to prevent integration problems later in development. 
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions with external systems to validate its overall behavior. Ensures the system meets functional requirements, performs under expected load conditions, and works properly in the intended environment. 
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software from the perspective of the end user to verify if it meets their requirements and is ready for deployment. Provides crucial feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience before releasing the software to the public. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests the smallest testable unit of code, like a single function or class, to ensure it performs as expected with specific inputs and outputs. Catches early bugs in individual code segments, allowing for faster and easier fixes, and provides a strong foundation for further testing levels. 
Integration Testing: Combines multiple tested units and verifies how they interact with each other, checking for issues at interfaces between components. Identifies problems that arise when different parts of the system are combined, ensuring smooth data flow and functionality between modules. 
System Testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole, including interactions with external systems and hardware, to evaluate its overall functionality and performance in a real-world scenario. Ensures the system operates as designed in its intended environment, identifying issues related to system integration and compatibility. 
Acceptance Testing: The final stage of testing where the software is evaluated by the end-user or client to confirm it meets their requirements and is ready for deployment. 
Provides a user-centric perspective on the software, validating if the system delivers the expected features and functions and addressing any usability concerns before release. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. Even though generative AI attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output. Prompt engineering is crucial for interacting with AI models because it allows users to effectively communicate their intent and desired outcome by carefully crafting the input prompts, leading to more accurate, relevant, and tailored responses from the AI, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience and maximizing the potential of the AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.\
Draw a tree.
Draw a old oak tree, with falling leaves, during the Autumn month on a sunny day in a park filled with other trees.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked rather than just a simple request.
Specific Details: Describing the trees appearance  and the background setting  gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
